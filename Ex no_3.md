# EX 3 C program to find number of years based on principle,rate & simple interest.
## DATE:
## Aim:
To write a C program to find number of years based on principle,rate & simple interest.

## Algorithm:
1. Start. 
2. Declare the variables. 
3. Prompt the user to enter a value. 
4. Read the value using scanf. 
5. Calculate the number of years using the formula: 
6. End .    

## Program:
```
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <math.h> 
int main() 
{ 
float p,n,r,si,ci; 
scanf("%f%f%f", &p,&n,&r); 
si=((p*n*r)/100); 
ci=(p)*(pow((1+ r/100),n)); 
printf("Simple Interest = %0.2f\nCompound Interest = %0.2f", si,ci); 
return 0; 
}
